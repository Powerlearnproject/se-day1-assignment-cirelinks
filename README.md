Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a disciplined approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The beginning of software engineering that started due to the growing software crisis.
The rise of object oriented programming that was needed to sustain code reusability and sustainability
Agile methodology and devops which was needed to cater for the growing needs of users by enabling continous integration of new code

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Defines project scope, goals, feasibility, resources, and potential risks before development begins.
Requirement Analysis – Gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders to create a clear project blueprint.
Design – Develops system architecture, database structures, UI/UX, and other technical specifications to serve as a blueprint for development.
Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and build the software according to the design specifications.
Testing – Identifies and fixes bugs, ensuring the software meets requirements and functions correctly before deployment.
Deployment – Releases the software for use, either in a testing environment, limited rollout, or full production.
Maintenance – Provides updates, bug fixes, and enhancements based on user feedback and evolving needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Water fall is best used in predictable projects such as when working with long term sustainable projects whereas agile methodologies are inclined more towards a fast paced changing environment such as when software requirements are expected to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Builds and maintains software by writing and testing code.
Quality Assurance Engineer – Ensures the software works correctly by identifying and fixing issues.
Project Manager – Oversees the project, ensuring it stays on track, meets deadlines, and aligns with goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs, like Visual Studio Code, streamline coding with features like auto-completion and debugging, while VCS, such as Git, tracks code changes and enables collaboration. IDEs enhance coding efficiency, whereas VCS ensures version control and teamwork, both essential for modern development

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
legacy systems where most organizations use old softwares with no documentation or original developers thus maintaining it becomes a challenge and this can be fixed by gradually changing softwares
Work life balance due to the flexibility of developers jobs and nature most programmers find it hard to keep their personal and work life separated and this can be managed by having clear work life balance

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation and helps detect bugs in the early process.
integration testing focuses on testing the interactions between different units or modules of the software and identifies issues that arise when integrating different parts of the software, which unit tests alone might not catch.
system testing tests the entire software system as a whole, ensuring that all components work together to meet the specified requirements.
acceptance testing, often performed by the client or end-user, verifies that the software meets their needs and expectations.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs to optimize AI responces to make ai responses more accurate.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt- tell me about food
improved prompt- what is the role of foood in living organisms
The improved prompt is more effective in that it narrows down the querry to just address food in living organisms rather than in diffrent structures such as economical or the world at large.
